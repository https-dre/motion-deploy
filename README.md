- Orchestrate configurable CI/CD pipelines
- Automatic Docker container build and management

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for future releases but are not yet implemented:

- Rollback mechanisms in case of failures

- Secure communication via TLS/HTTPS and access authentication

- Scalability for multiple repositories and concurrent deployments

- Detailed monitoring with logs and notifications


## Requirements

- Docker installed and running on the host machine
- GitHub account with repositories configured to send webhooks
- Go 1.18+ to build the application
- TLS certificates for secure communication (optional but recommended)

---
